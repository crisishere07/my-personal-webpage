        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my blog! I’m excited to share my journey with you, filled with stories of family, faith, and resilience. My name is Cristina Zavala, and I am a proud mother of four amazing children and a loving grandmother to a delightful granddaughter. This blog is a space where I will open up about my life, the challenges we face, and the joy we find in everyday moments.</p>
        <p>I am a mother to four wonderful children, whose ages range from 26 to 32. My oldest child, Christy, is 32, and she has always been a guiding light in our family. My second child, Brittany, is the mother of my adorable five-year-old granddaughter, who brings endless joy and laughter into our lives. The youngest members of our family are my twin boys, Matt and Thomas, who are 26 years old and have always been a dynamic duo, keeping us on our toes.</p>
        <p>Our family extends beyond my children and granddaughter. My father lives with us, bravely managing life with one kidney and undergoing dialysis treatments. His strength and determination are a constant source of inspiration for us all. Additionally, my husband, Greg, is battling Parkinson's disease. Together, we navigate the ups and downs of his condition, leaning on each other for support and finding solace in our faith.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, our family experienced the greatest loss we have ever faced. My mother passed away from cancer after battling the disease twice. She was my closest friend and mentor, and I miss her every day. Watching her suffer through cancer twice was incredibly difficult, especially as I was the one taking her to treatments and providing comfort. She found solace in me, and her anxiety was something we faced together. Her loss was a huge blow to our family, and we have felt her absence deeply ever since. I also have three siblings: an older brother, a younger brother, and a baby sister. Together, we have leaned on each other for support during this tough time.</p>
        <p>Juggling a full-time job while caring for my family is no small feat, but we manage to take things one step at a time. Our household is a bustling hub of activity, filled with love, laughter, and occasional chaos. Despite the challenges we face, we are a close-knit family that supports one another through thick and thin.</p>
        <p>Our journey is deeply rooted in faith. We believe that with God’s guidance, we can overcome any obstacle. This unwavering faith is what keeps us strong and united as a family. Through this blog, I hope to share not just our struggles, but also the lessons we've learned and the hope that keeps us going.</p>
